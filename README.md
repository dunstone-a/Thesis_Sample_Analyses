# Thesis Sample Analyses

This is a repository to accompany my MSc thesis titled "Statistical methods and software tools for the analysis of multi-state QTL data".

Note that the packages "QTLExperiment" and "multistateQTL" have their own repositories. 

This repo shows how I performed analysis for Chapter 4 and Chapter 5 of my thesis. 
These chapters feature two example data sets:

- Chapter 4: Data from the GTEx consortium. Bulk tissue data. 

- Chapter 5: Data from the Natri (2024) paper titled "Cell-type-specific and disease-associated
expression quantitative trait loci in the
human lung". This is single-cell multi-state eQTL data with 38 cell types. I subset this data to 10 cell types to reduce computation time.
