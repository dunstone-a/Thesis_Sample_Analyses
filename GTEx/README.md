# Case Study 1: GTEx Consortium

The R script `subset_gtex_data.R` was used to extract the GTEx data for some of the selected states. 
There are instructions at the beginning of this file explaining where to download the data from. 

Then the R Markdown file `GTEx.Rmd` can be used to generate a `.tex` file which renders to become Chapter 4.
