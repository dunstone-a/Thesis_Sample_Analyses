# Chapter 5: 
# Case Study 2: Lung Data

The files were ran in the following order:

```
1_download_data.R
2_extract_data.sh
3_subset_data.R
4_run_mashr.R
```

The bash script `run_mashr_job.sh` was used to run file `4_run_mashr.R` to perform multivariate adaptive shrinkage on the eQTL data. 

The seurat related analysis is distinct as it only uses the scRNA-seq data and not the genotype data. 

```
5_subset_seurat.R
6_explore_seurat.R
```

Finally, the pages shown in Chapter 5 are created from the `.tex` file which comes from knitting `Chapter_5_Analysis.Rmd` to a `.pdf`.
Note that the `.pdf` will not be able to render without the preamble which is contained in my overleaf `.tex` project.
